You can help in different ways:

<h3> 1. Give us money</h3>

<b>You can make direct donations via Nequi or Daviplata to the number 3143860220 (and send us the receipt via WhatsApp to the same number). If you prefer to make a transfer, please write to us on that number via Whatsapp.</b>

When making cash donations to Maya Airways, you will receive a poster or another gift.

<h3> 2. Buy bicycles or things</h3>

- If you want a <b>bicycle</b>, fill out [this form](https://forms.gle/LUj8iSi9KSTw4Zdc8). See the section below for more details.
- If you want <b>posters</b>, go to the [Moovil Store](https://www.instagram.com/moovil_co/) (Calle 71 # 10-47, Bogot√°).
- If you want <b>something else</b>, please give us a few weeks as we almost have them available.

<b>You can also buy some Maya merch that you can find on our instagram</b> through [@maya_airways](https://www.instagram.com/maya_airways/).

3. Give bicycles or parts

These bicycles or parts will be transformed into Maya Airways fleet (this has already been done, for example, by Ozon in October 2022, and subsequently by individuals and other companies); Sometimes the spare parts also serve to make jewelry or Maya merch.

4. Give time

You can make a reservation to help in the workshop [through this link](https://calendar.app.google/tesrKdrWrVMdAWqr7).
